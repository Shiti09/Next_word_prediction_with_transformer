# 🚀 Next-Word Prediction for Medical Notes Using MT Samples

## **1. Introduction**
Medical transcription (MT) plays a crucial role in healthcare documentation, yet it remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. This project leverages transformer-based language models to enhance next-word prediction in medical notes, significantly improving transcription accuracy and efficiency.

## 2. Business Case
### 📌 Problem Statement:
- Medical transcriptionists and physicians spend considerable time manually typing notes.
- Errors in documentation can lead to misinterpretations, medical errors, and inefficiencies.
- Existing speech-to-text solutions lack context-aware next-word prediction optimized for medical terminology.

### ✅ Solution:
- This AI-powered next-word prediction model improves documentation speed and reduces cognitive load for medical professionals.
- Built using transformer models (GPT-based/LLMs) trained on medical transcription (MT) samples.

### 💰 Business Impact:
🔹 30-40% reduction in typing time for clinicians and transcriptionists.
🔹 Fewer documentation errors, improving patient safety and compliance.
🔹 Potential integration into EHR systems, speech-to-text solutions, and medical transcription software.

## 3. Technical Overview
### 🛠️ Model Used:
- Transformer-based models- GPT-2
- Fine-tuned on medical transcription datasets (HIPAA-compliant).

### 📊 Training Pipeline:

Step 1: Data preprocessing (removing noise, structuring notes).
Step 2: Tokenization and embedding with medical context awareness.
Step 3: Model training with optimized hyperparameters.
